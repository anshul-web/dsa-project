Hello. 
My name is Aarchi Choudhury. I am from Guwahati, Assam. I am currently pursuing Masters of Computer Applications from Harcourt Butler Technical University, Kanpur. I have done my graduation in Bachelors of Computer Applications from Cotton University. During my academics I have tried to developed Programming skills as i have a strong foundation in Problem solving. I have solved more than 1000 questions in the span of one year. This helped me in learning time management as well. I have also participated in several coding contests held by different coding platforms such as leetcode, codechef, codeforces. Recently I have developed a project which was around Android development. It was a women safety Android application which was based on Java programming language for backend and XML for frontend. Also I have a strong grasp in languages such as HTML, CSS etc and core subjects such as Operating system, database management system, Object oriented programming. Also, I was the class representative in my graduation period and currently I am a part of training and placement team which helped me in developing good communication skills. This will further help in interacting with my team members if I will be a part of your esteemed organization. This was all about my brief introduction. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
